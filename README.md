Seekers Beyond the Shroud
-------------------------

Sheets, notes, and play records for my foray into [Seekers Beyond the Shroud][1].

Played as time allows, with the timeline never extending beyond the present day.

Phases of the Moon correspond to the game's astrological mechanics, not real life's.

Characters:
- G (2020-10-12 to Present)

Deviations:
- Moved from v1.0 to v1.1 after session 1 (2020-10-12)
- Using [The Yokai Bestiary][2] in place of the generic Y≈çkai Foe, if or when I encounter them.
- Using the **Retreating From Combat** option (v1.1 p. 56) to make the Retreat Talent available to all characters, and usable in all combats provided it makes sense (e.g. there's somewhere to escape to, character is not trapped, and so on).
